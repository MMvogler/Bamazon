# Bamazon
This project was created during the 12th week of Vanderbilt University's Coding Bootcamp. This CLI App works like an Amazon storefront by prompting the user to select from different purchase choices. This app then calculates the appropriate price for the choice and quantity requested, updating the store's inventory as the user goes along.
